In other words, this shebang line says that, when I type in `./my_script.py`, the shell will actually run `/usr/bin/env python my_script.py`\" - Sam King"

    "The Command Line by Amanda Farah\n",
    "\n",
    "The command line is kind of like a much more powerful Finder, but you have to type everything instead of clicking. You can move files, copy them, create them, rename them, move between folders, create them, rename them. In the command line, you can launch any application you want, open any file you want, search for files, search for strings in files, and much more. Think of it as a way to speak more directly to your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The command line is a very powerful interface for your computer, but it is also a universal interface for all Unix-based computers (Macs and PCs running Linux or other Unix operating systems, but not Windows machines). Therefore, the command line is how you will interact with computing clusters/supercomputers. Most clusters don't have a way to control them graphically (i.e. by clicking on things). Instead, they just have a command line interface. Even if they do have a graphical interface, its usually very cumbersome, slow, and limited. Therefore, learning command line syntax is the way to go. Therefore, when you eventually scale up your code to use clusters, you might find it helpful to come back to this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The languages most commonly used on the command line are `bash` and `zsh`. They are very similar, and for our intents and purposes, they are the same. I'll probably just refer to both of them as `bash`.\n",
    "\n",

    "git pull\n",

    "Git is a software installed on your computer, like python or microsoft word. This line says \"run the software called git.

    "    - We will download the \"research and development survey\" from this website: https://www.stats.govt.nz/large-datasets/csv-files-for-download/\n",
    "    - do this using `curl` in two ways:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    curl https://www.stats.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Research-and-development-survey/Research-and-development-survey-2021/Download-data/Research-and-development-survey-2021-CSV-notes.csv\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This downloads the file and displays it. But if we want to save the file on our computer, we will use the `-o` option and specify a file. We will save the data to a file called \"RnD.csv\" in the output directory.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    curl -o ../output/RnD.csv https://www.stats.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Research-and-development-survey/Research-and-development-survey-2021/Download-data/Research-and-development-survey-2021-CSV-notes.csv\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Once you do this, run `ls ../output/` and see if your new file is there.\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Find files using `find`\n",
    "    - Finally! A command named something that makes sense. This is used when I'm looking for a file but I don't know where it is on my computer. Check out the documetation [here](https://linux.die.net/man/1/find).\n",
    "    - The general form is: `find <starting directory> <matching criteria and actions>`\n",
    "    - So, if we want to find all `txt` files in the \"output\" directory, we can do \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    find ../output -name \"*.txt\" -print\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    The first argument is the place to look for your files (here, it was `../output`) then, its all optional arguments. These are a lot like keyword arguments in python. The first optional argument is `-name` which accepts a pattern. This is the pattern we are searching for (here, it was `\"*.txt\"` where we used `*` as a wildcard. The second optional argument is `-print`, which tells find to print the output of its search. Try to run the command.\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Find contents in files using `grep`\n",
    "    - Syntax: `grep <string to search for> <options> <starting directory>`\n",
    "    - Look for all lines in all files that have the string \"Huron\", starting one level up, and going \"recusrively\" through all directoryies under our starting directory:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    grep \"Huron\" -r ../\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Here, \"Huron\" is the string we want to search for, \"-r\" is telling `find` to go recursively (meaning go through each sub directory under the starting directory), and \"../\" means start one directory up from where we are now.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very useful to keep a small text file (or other set of notes) of useful commands. Unlike `python`, `bash` and `zsh` don't have very intuitive syntax or naming conventions, so it can be hard to memorize their commands. Katie, Maria, and Amanda all keep a short list of useful commands, especially ones with confusing syntax, along with explanations of how to use them."

    "### 4. Python in The Terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these steps:\n",
    "1. Open a new terminal tab or window\n",
    "2. Navigate to your working directory, like we do every day. We will work out of the `notebooks` directory.\n",
    "3. Type `python`\n",
    "    - Your terminal should display something similar to the following:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Python 3.8.5 (default, Sep  4 2020, 02:22:02) \n",
    "    [Clang 10.0.0 ] :: Anaconda, Inc. on darwin\n",
    "    Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n",
    "    >>> \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - If it displays `Python 3.X`, where `X` is any value, you are good!\n",
    "    - If it displays `Python 2.Y` for any value of Y, type `exit()` and press enter. Then type `python3`. Ask a TA if this doesn't work.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. You are now running python interactively! Let's try a few things out to see how interactive python works.\n",
    "    - Type a print statement with a string as the argument to `print()`. Press enter\n",
    "    - Type a mathematical expression (e.g. `1+1`) and press enter\n",
    "    - Notice that inputs are always on lines denoted by `>>>` or `...` and outputs start newlines without these characters.\n",
    "5. Let's try some more nuanced commands that we are used to using on Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "    - Try some of our usual imports (e.g. `import numpy as np`, then try `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`)\n",
    "    - Define a variable, calling it whatever you want and giving it whatever value you want, using any datatype you want. Press enter.\n",
    "    - Type the variable's name. Press enter.\n",
    "5. Now let's try some code we've seen before to see what happens in interactive mode.\n",
    "    - First, I'll copy some things from Day 2, where we had some fun with lists. Start by replicating the following line in your terminal, then follow along with the instructor. Try to predict what will happen with each line before pressing enter.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    animals = ['cat', 'dog', 'squid', 'moose', 'falcon']\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - Now, we will try some things using `pandas`. Remember, to use a package we need to import it first. We haven't imported `pandas` yet, so lets do that now.\n",
    "    - We're going to load in some data that we used earlier. This data is stored in a csv format. I don't quite remember the syntax for the `pandas` function for this, but we don't want to leave the terminal because that's a lot of work, so lets try the built in `help()` function. \n",
    "    - It works very similarly to using it in jupyter! you can even scroll. However, there's no buttons to close out of the viewing mode once you're in it, so you'll have to type `q` to leave after you've read everything you need.\n",
    "    - You can re-run the same line without having to re-type the whole thing by using the \"up\" button on your keyboard.\n",
    "    - Looking at the docstring, it seems like the first argument is the file name, and all other arguments are optional. the default delimiter is `,`, which is exactly what we want, so we can just go with default behavior.\n",
    "    - Load in the file but don't assign it to a variable. You'll have to figure out the path. The file's name is `Pokemon.csv` and it is in the `data` directory. \n",
    "    - You should see the column names as well as the first and last 5 rows of data.\n",
    "    - Now load in the file but this time assign it to a variable. I'll call my variable `data`. Notice how there's no output now.\n",
    "    - _**Coding check-in:**_ Play around with your dataframe. How many Pokemon have Grass as their first type? What's the mean attack value?\n",
    "6. How does plotting work?\n",
    "    - With our nice graphical user interface (GUI) gone, we're stuck with a very basic looking screen that doesn't seem like it has support for the beautiful plots you've learned how to make. What happens when you try to make a plot?\n",
    "    - We've already imported `matplotlib` and `numpy`, so we have all the libraries we need for a simple plot. \n",
    "    - Make an array full of increasing `float` values.\n",
    "    - Plot the square of that array vs the array itself.\n",
    "    - you might get taken away from the terminal for seemingly no reason. There is a reason, just go back to the terminal for now.\n",
    "    - Run `plt.show()`. A plot should pop up.\n",
    "    - You must close your plot to have access to the command line again.\n",
    "7. Functions\n",
    "    - Write a simple \"hello world!\" function.\n",
    "    - You have to provide your own indentation in interactive python. Otherwise you will get the dreaded `IndentationError: expected an indented block`!\n",
    "    - An empty newline indicates you're done writing the function. \n",
    "    - `...` indicates being inside an indented block, `>>>` indicates being outside of it\n",
    "    - Call your function.\n",
    "    - Write a function that takes in one argument, applies something to it, and returns a new value.\n",
    "    - Call your function.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I'm writing a super long function or a complex plotting script and I make a typo, I have to go and redo everything. Even with our newly-beloved \"up\" key, this is extremely annoying. An obvious solution might be to go back to jupyter notebooks, but there are many situations in which that is not possible. Instead, we will move on to a generally useful tool, `.py` scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Leave interactive mode by typing `exit()`. Don't close your terminal window."
